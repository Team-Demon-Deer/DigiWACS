# DigiWACS
DigiWACS is a work-in-progress stack for real-time coordination of simulated tactical operations and air traffic control. The software consists of two components: a cross-platform native client written in .NET Core with Avalonia UI, and a set of dockerized services for providing a pipeline between a DCS-gRPC service instance (Tacview ACMI support TBD).
